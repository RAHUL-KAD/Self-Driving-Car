1. How does LIDAR mapping works?

    It is used to map surfaces, jungals and also in self dirivng car we use it to get a 3d map of our surrondings.

    It sends a light, that light gets reflected by an object and then reflected light is detected by a syste recevier and time of fligh is used to develop a distance map of the objects in the scene.
