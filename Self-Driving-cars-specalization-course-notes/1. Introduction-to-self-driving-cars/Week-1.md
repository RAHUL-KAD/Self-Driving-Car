## Week 1

### A. Taxonomy of driving
1. What makes up a driving task?

    - Lateral control: steering
    - Longitudinal control: breaking and accelerating
    - Object and Event detection and Response(ODER): detection and reaction
    - Planning: Long term and short term

2. Autonomous Copabilities

    - Automated lateral control
    - automated longituted control
    - OEDR

        - automatic emergency response
        - driver supervision
    - Complete vs restricted ODD
        
### B. Precption
1. What is precption?
    
    - In precption we want to make sense of environment and ourselves.
    - Two things that we need to identify

        1. Identification   
        2. understanding motion 
    - Why - to inform our driving decisions

2. Goals of precption

    1. static objects

        - road and lane marking
        - curbs
        - traffic lights
        - road signs
        - contruction signs, obstractions and more
    2. dynamic objetcs

        - person
        - vehicles
        - animals

    **3. Ego location**
     
    - Data for ego location comes from GPU, IMU and odomentry sensors
    - position
    - velocity, accelarion
    - orientation and angular motion
